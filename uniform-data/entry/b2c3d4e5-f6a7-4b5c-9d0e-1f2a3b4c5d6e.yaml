                      When it comes to coffeehouse classics, few drinks are as
                      beloved and frequently debated as the cappuccino and the
                      latte. Both have become staples in cafes around the world,
                      each with its own loyal following. Whether you’re a
                      seasoned coffee enthusiast or just starting to explore the
                      world of espresso-based beverages, understanding the
                      differences between these two drinks can help you make the
                      perfect choice for your next coffee break.

                      A traditional cappuccino is a harmonious blend of three
                      equal parts: espresso, steamed milk, and milk foam.
                      Typically, a barista will pull a shot of espresso, add an
                      equal amount of steamed milk, and then top it off with a
                      thick, velvety layer of milk foam. This classic
                      ratio—1:1:1—creates a balanced yet bold drink.

                      The texture of a cappuccino is one of its defining
                      features. The generous foam cap not only insulates the
                      drink, keeping it warm, but also provides a light, airy
                      mouthfeel. The foam acts as a buffer, mellowing the
                      intensity of the espresso while still allowing its robust
                      flavors to shine through. The result is a drink that is
                      rich, strong, and slightly creamy, with a pronounced
                      espresso kick and a luxurious, frothy finish.

                      A latte, short for "caffè latte" (Italian for "milk
                      coffee"), is made with a shot (or sometimes two) of
                      espresso, a much larger amount of steamed milk, and a thin
                      layer of milk foam on top. The typical ratio is about 1
                      part espresso to 3 or more parts steamed milk, with just a
                      small cap of foam—much less than in a cappuccino.

                      Lattes are known for their creamy, smooth texture. The
                      abundance of steamed milk creates a velvety, almost silky
                      mouthfeel, making the drink feel indulgent and comforting.
                      The espresso flavor is present but much more subdued
                      compared to a cappuccino, resulting in a milder, sweeter
                      taste that appeals to those who prefer a less intense
                      coffee experience. The thin layer of foam adds a touch of
                      lightness without dominating the drink.
